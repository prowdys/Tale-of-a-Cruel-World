## "The source of divinity a God embodies,  being the ten primal commands which He utilized to create all things."

Aspects are the divine fragments of power held by the **[[New Gods]],** after the murder of the progenitor god, **[[Couret]].** Each Aspect embodies a fundamental force or concept that Couret embodied, and usually has a counterpart. 

Each Aspect defines the scope of a New God's influence on the world at large, and the will attached to the power can often restrict them as much as it empowers them. The Aspects are as follows, and will be updated as more are written/discovered:

**Creation,** the force behind the genesis of the world.
**Fate,** the force that governs destiny, the future, and the inevitability of all outcomes.
## Champion

A New God can name a mortal as their Champion, allowing them a form of access to their Aspect. The details of what this fully entails are yet unknown.
